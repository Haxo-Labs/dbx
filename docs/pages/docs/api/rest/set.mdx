# Set Operations

DBX provides comprehensive set operations through its REST API. Set operations allow you to store and manage collections of unique values, similar to Redis sets.

## Overview

Set operations support storing collections of unique values under a single key, making them ideal for storing tags, user groups, unique identifiers, or any collection where duplicates are not allowed.

## Endpoints

## Use Cases

### 1. Online Users Tracking

```bash
# Add user to online set
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/set/online-users/member/user123

# Check if user is online
curl http://localhost:8080/api/set/online-users/member/user123/exists

# Get online user count
curl http://localhost:8080/api/set/online-users/cardinality

# Remove user when they go offline
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/set/online-users/member/user123
```

### 2. Tag Management

```bash
# Store post tags
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/set/post:123:tags \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "members": ["javascript", "nodejs", "api"],
       "ttl": 86400
     }'

# Add new tag
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/set/post:123:tags/member/redis

# Check if post has specific tag
curl http://localhost:8080/api/set/post:123:tags/member/javascript/exists
```

### 3. Unique Collections

```bash
# Store unique IP addresses
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/set/unique-visitors \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "members": ["192.168.1.100", "192.168.1.101", "10.0.0.50"],
       "ttl": 3600
     }'

# Add new visitor
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/set/unique-visitors/member/192.168.1.102

# Get unique visitor count
curl http://localhost:8080/api/set/unique-visitors/cardinality
```

### 4. User Groups and Permissions

```bash
# Store admin users
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/set/admins \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "members": ["user1", "user2", "user3"]
     }'

# Check if user is admin
curl http://localhost:8080/api/set/admins/member/user1/exists

# Add new admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/set/admins/member/user4
```

## Error Handling

All endpoints return consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "error": "not_found",
  "message": "Set key 'online-users' not found",
  "status": 404
}
```

Common error types:

- `not_found` - Set key doesn't exist
- `member_not_found` - Member doesn't exist in set
- `invalid_key` - Key format is invalid
- `invalid_member` - Member format is invalid
- `duplicate_member` - Member already exists in set
- `server_error` - Internal server error

## Performance Considerations

1. **Set Size** - Large sets may impact performance for operations like `GET`
2. **Member Uniqueness** - DBX automatically handles duplicates
3. **Batch Operations** - Use batch endpoints for multiple operations
4. **TTL Management** - Set appropriate TTL values for set expiration

## Data Types

Set members support various data types:

- **Strings** - Most common, stored as-is
- **Numbers** - Stored as strings, can be parsed by client
- **UUIDs** - Stored as strings
- **JSON** - Stored as stringified JSON (not recommended for sets)

## Rate Limits

Set operations are subject to the same rate limiting as other API endpoints:

- Default: 100 requests per minute per IP
- Configurable via environment variables
